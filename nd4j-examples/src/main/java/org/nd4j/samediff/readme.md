# SameDiff Examples

SameDiff is an automatic differentiation library built on top of ND4J.
It can be considered comparable to TensorFlow or PyTorch, in that users can define a set of forward
pass operations and SameDiff will automatically

For further details, see the SameDiff documentation at: [TODO]

Note also that a number of Deeplearning4j examples demonstrate how to use SameDiff to create DL4J layers and
vertices as part of a Deeplearning4j MultiLayerNetwork or ComputationGraph.
